In this Demo Project, I learned different ways to style React Components dynamically.
There are 4 options:
* Using dynamic inline CSS on the components.
* Setting CSS classes dynamically.
These options can result in styling conflicts as CSS classes are globally scoped.

* Using the Styled Components library (styles are encapsulated withing component definitions).
* Using CSS Modules.
These options are better because the styling is component specific.

I personally prefer the CSS modules approach because it keeps the CSS files and Javascript files seperated resulting in a more 
organized approach.
